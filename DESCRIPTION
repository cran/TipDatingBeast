Description: Assists performing tip-dating of phylogenetic trees with BEAST 
    BEAST is a popular software for phylogenetic analysis.
    The package assists the implementation of various phylogenetic tip-
	dating tests using BEAST. It contains two main functions.
	The first one allows preparing date randomization analyses, 
	which assess the temporal signal of a data set. 
	The second function allows performing leave-one-out analyses,
	which test for the consistency between independent calibration sequences
	and allow pinpointing those leading to potential bias.
	The included tutorial provides detailed step-by-step instructions.
	An expanded description of the package can be found in article:

	TIPDATINGBEAST: an R package to assist the implementation of phylogenetic
	tip-dating tests using BEAST. Molecular Ecology Resources, 17: 608-613.
